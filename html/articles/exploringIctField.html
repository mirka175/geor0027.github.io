            <h2>7 IT Career Paths and How to Get Started in 2024</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">It might be easy to assume that working in information technology (IT) means
                working in a tech office in a
                big city. But that's not the whole truth. IT skills are needed in places like hospitals, local
                governments,
                banks, and universities in smaller cities across the country. According to the US Bureau of Labor
                Statistics, about 377,500 job openings are projected each year on average in IT [1].<br>

                That said, the world of IT offers a variety of career paths in diverse industries. An IT professional
                can
                specialize in cybersecurity to keep computers safe, cloud computing to make information easier to
                access, or
                in help desk roles to assist in the everyday functions of an organization.</p>

            <h3>IT career paths</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Understanding what paths are available to you can help you navigate your
                first steps as you begin your
                career in IT.<br>

                Not sure where to start? Many IT professionals begin in generalist roles that cover a range of issues,
                like
                help desk technician or IT associate. You may get an entry-level IT certification to help you land one
                of
                these roles, though it's often not required. Once you've gained some experience and have a better grasp
                of
                what you like doing, you might think about focusing your career on a more specific area. You can explore
                entry-level IT jobs to see what other routes you can take if you're just starting out.<br>

                Job outlook information is sourced from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and applies to the
                period
                2022 to 2032, unless stated otherwise.<br>

            </p>

            <h3>1. Computer support</h3>
            <p>Many in the beginning phases of their IT career work in computer support roles that support many
                different
                aspects of computer operations. From there, it's possible to specialize in a narrower field like
                cybersecurity or networks, or continue in computer support to become a senior or manager.<br>

            </p>
            <h3>2. Cybersecurity</h3>
            <p>Working in cybersecurity means protecting computer systems, devices, and sensitive information from
                malware,unauthorized access, damage, and data breaches. Cybersecurity is one of two fields in IT
                expected to see the most demand, according to Global Knowledge, an IT professional development company
                (the other being cloud computing).<br>

                <b>Salary:</b>$112,000<br>

                <b>Projected job growth:</b>32% [3]<br>

            <h3>3. Networks and systems</h3>
            <p>Network IT professionals work with network-related tasks or hardware, and systems professionals work
                among
                servers and computer systems. They may have overlapping roles, particularly at smaller companies where
                you’re more likely to have to wear many hats. You might start as an analyst or administrator, and then
                work
                your way up to being a network or systems engineer or architect.<br>

                <b>Salary:</b>$90,520<br>

                <b>Projected job growth:</b>2%<br>

                <b>Early career jobs:</b>Network administrator, systems administrator, network implementation
                technician, systems
                analyst<br>

                network
                engineer, senior systems administrator, computer network architects<br>

                <b>Getting started:</b>Several certification options exist for networks and systems, like the CompTIA
                Server+ or
                the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA). Otherwise, you can start as a generalist on the IT help
                desk
                and work your way into one of these specialities.<br>

            <h3>4. Software development</h3>
            <p>Software developers, or software engineers, create computer programs that are used to accomplish any
                number of tasks—your internet browser, music streaming service, and online video conference app are all
                examples of software. Software development can open paths into a variety of different industries,
                including finance, video game development, and tech.<br>

                <b>Salary:</b>$142,200<br>

                <b>Projected job growth:</b>25% [5]<br>

                <b>Jobs:</b>Software engineer, software developer, senior software engineer<br>

                <b>Getting started:</b>Learning the coding languages used in software development will be key to landing
                a job
                in the field. Try starting with commonly requested ones like Python, Java, or Ruby.<br>

                <b>Learn Python in just two months</b>while earning a <b>certificate from the University of Michigan</b>
                by enrolling
                in Python for Everybody, a beginner-friendly, flexible online program.
            </p>
            <h3>5. Web development</h3>
            <p>Working in web development means you'll be responsible for creating and maintaining websites and phone
                applications. Web developers can be front-end or back-end developers—that is, the front-facing
                interfaces or
                behind-the-scenes mechanics of a website, respectively—or both.<br>

                <b>Salary:</b>$80,730<br>

                <b>Projected job growth:</b>16% [6]<br>

                development jobs
                often prioritize relevant experience over credentials. Taking a course in a web programming
                language—like
                Python, JavaScript, CSS, or HTML—can get you oriented with the basics. From there, you can try building
                your
                own website or application before applying to entry-level jobs.
            </p>
            <h3>6. Data</h3>
            <p>With the ubiquity of internet-connected devices, companies have access to unprecedented amounts of data
                on their customers, services, and other business factors. And though data isn't a traditional IT
                specialization, the increase in demand for data skills makes it a solid career option for those looking
                for IT-related work. Working with data can entail keeping up hardware and security as a data technician,
                or sifting through data to find patterns and insights as a data analyst or scientist.<br>

                <b>Salary:</b>$112,120<br>

                <b>Projected job growth:</b>8% [7]<br>

                <b>Early career jobs:</b>Data center technician, database administrator, data analyst<br>

                <b>Mid-career or senior jobs:</b>Data scientist, data engineer, data architect<br>

                <b>Getting started:</b>If you're interested in becoming a data technician, some background knowledge of
                IT
                support might help. If the idea of working directly with data is more enticing to you, consider getting
                a certification in data analytics—like the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate or the Google Data
                Analytics Professional Certificate.<br>

            <p>A career in cloud technology generally includes some programming on cloud software platforms like Azure,
                AWS, or Google Cloud. <br>
