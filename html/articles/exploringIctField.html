            <h2>7 IT Career Paths and How to Get Started in 2024</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">It might be easy to assume that working in information technology (IT) means
                working in a tech office in a
                big city. But that's not the whole truth. IT skills are needed in places like hospitals, local
                governments,
                banks, and universities in smaller cities across the country. According to the US Bureau of Labor
                Statistics, about 377,500 job openings are projected each year on average in IT [1].<br>

                That said, the world of IT offers a variety of career paths in diverse industries. An IT professional
                can
                specialize in cybersecurity to keep computers safe, cloud computing to make information easier to
                access, or
                in help desk roles to assist in the everyday functions of an organization.</p>

            <h3>IT career paths</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"></p>Understanding what paths are available to you can help you navigate your
            first steps as you begin your
            career in IT.<br>

            Not sure where to start? Many IT professionals begin in generalist roles that cover a range of issues, like
            help desk technician or IT associate. You may get an entry-level IT certification to help you land one of
            these roles, though it's often not required. Once you've gained some experience and have a better grasp of
            what you like doing, you might think about focusing your career on a more specific area. You can explore
            entry-level IT jobs to see what other routes you can take if you're just starting out.<br>

            Job outlook information is sourced from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and applies to the period
            2022 to 2032, unless stated otherwise.<br>
